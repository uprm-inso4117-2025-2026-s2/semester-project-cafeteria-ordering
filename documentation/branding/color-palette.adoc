:toclevels: 2

== Objective

Define a consistent, accessible, and scalable color palette for the Cafeteria Ordering System that supports usability, readability, and visual consistency across light and dark UI modes.

The palette is designed for a student-focused cafeteria experience: clean, modern, friendly, and easy on the eyes.

== Color Palette

=== Primary Color

Used for branding, primary actions, and key interactive elements.

[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Name | HEX | RGB | Usage
| Primary Green | #2E7D32 | 46, 125, 50 | Primary buttons, active states, highlights, CTA elements
|===

*Notes:*
- Represents freshness and food-related branding
- Strong contrast and recognizable brand anchor

=== Secondary Colors (Pastel)

Soft accent colors that complement the primary green without overpowering the UI.

| Pastel Peach | #FFCCBC | 255, 204, 188 | Promotions, badges, empty states, friendly accents

*Why these work:*
- Sage stays within the green family for harmony
- Peach adds warmth and approachability
- Both feel modern and student-friendly

=== Neutral Colors

Calm neutrals that work well with pastel accents and support light/dark modes.
