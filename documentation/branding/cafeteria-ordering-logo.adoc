== Logo Design Elements
The logo was created to reflect the core functionalities of the Cafeteria Ordering System in a simple and clean design. The main design elements include:

- The letter *"C"* represents *"Cafeteria"* and is stylized to resemble both a plate and the outer rim of a clock.
- The center dot represents the letter *"O"* for *"Ordering"* and symbolizes the center of a clock.
- The clock hands are designed as a fork and spoon, representing the food and time efficiency aspects of the system.
- The outer lines to the left of the *"C"* represent speed and its priority in the ordering to food pickup process.

== Usage Guidelines and Color Palette

The logo is designed to support both light and dark UI themes.

=== Logo Theme Usage

- The *Light Mode* logo should be used on light backgrounds.
- The *Dark Mode* logo should be used on dark backgrounds.
- The appropriate version should always be selected to maintain visibility, contrast, readability and aesthetics.

=== Logo Variant Usage 

- The *With Text* versions should be used in documentation, headers, and larger UI placements.
- The *No Text* versions should be used for icons, navigation bars, and smaller UI components.

=== Color Palette

The logo color palette aligns with the official project color scheme defined in *`documentation/branding/color-palette.adoc`*. To ensure the project’s branding identity is maintained, logo colors should not be modified outside of the defined palette and the logo should not be placed on backgrounds that reduce contrast.
