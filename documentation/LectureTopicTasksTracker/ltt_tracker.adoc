:toc:
:sectnums:

== Purpose

This document is a centralized LTT tracker file to document completed, reserved, and upcoming LTT topics, where contributors update and propose new Lecture Topic Tasks (LTTs).

This document:

- Archives completed lecture topic tasks accompanied by a brief summary of the artifact.

- Lists all reserved LTTs to prevent task duplication and loss of effort.

- Proposes new, relevant LTTs that follow the approved structure (see `documentation\LectureTopicTasks\LTTFramework.adoc`).

== Scope

This document aims to systematically track past, current, and future LTTs throughout the semester.
