= Lecture Topic Task (LTT) tracker
:toc:
:sectnums:

== Purpose

This document is a centralized LTT tracker file to document completed, reserved, and upcoming LTT topics, where contributors update and propose new Lecture Topic Tasks (LTTs).

This document:

- Archives completed lecture topic tasks accompanied by a brief summary of the artifact.

- Lists all reserved LTTs to prevent task duplication and loss of effort.

- Proposes new, relevant LTTs that follow the approved structure (see `documentation\LectureTopicTasks\LTTFramework.adoc`).

== Scope

This document serves as the centralized registry for all Lecture Topic Tasks (LTTs) related to the Cafeteria Ordering System project. The scope encompasses:

- *Completed LTTs*: Documentation of all successfully delivered lecture topic tasks, including their deliverables and the evidence supporting their completion.

- *Reserved LTTs*: Tasks that have been claimed and are currently in progress, preventing duplicate efforts and ensuring efficient resource allocation across the team.

- *Proposed LTTs*: New tasks identified as relevant and valuable to the project that align with the established LTT framework and project objectives.

- *Lifecycle Tracking*: Systematic monitoring of LTTs throughout their complete lifecycle, from proposal through completion, ensuring visibility and accountability.
