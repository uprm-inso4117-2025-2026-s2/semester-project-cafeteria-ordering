= Test Estimations and Test Schedule
:toc:
:sectnums:
:doctype: article

== Overview

This document defines the testing effort estimations and the overall test schedule for the project.  
The goal of this document is to ensure proper planning, reduce risks, and align with the team's project timeline.

Owner: L-A-M-D

---

== 1. Estimation Approach

=== Method

Testing effort is estimated in *person-hours* using the following components:

- Test Design
- Test Implementation
- Test Execution
- Defect Verification
- Reporting & Documenting

=== Assumptions

- Team produces testable builds.
- Staging environment will be available before system testing.
- Requirements are sufficiently stable.
- One primary QA owner with developer support.
- Contains a great architecture.

== 2. Test Phases and Effort Estimates

[cols="1,3,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Phase | Activities Included | Estimate (hrs) | Notes / Justification

| Test Planning
| Test plan outline, scope definition, risk analysis
| 6
| One-time planning and alignment 

| Test Case Design
| Create test cases for core and edge flows
| 12
| Based on expected feature scope 

| Unit Testing Support
| Coverage review and guidance
| 8
| Developer-owned with QA oversight 

| Integration Testing
| API and database integration validation
| 14
| Higher risk area for React apps 

| System Testing
| End-to-end validation and error handling
| 16
| Requires stable staging build 

| Regression Testing
| Core suite re-execution after fixes
| 10
| Assumes two regression cycles 

| UAT Preparation and Support
| UAT checklist and stakeholder support
| 8
| Includes coordination overhead

| Defect Verification
| Fix validation and retesting
| 10
| Conservative baseline

| Reporting
| Test summary and sign-off
| 4
| Final stakeholder deliverable
|===

*Subtotal:* 88 hrs  
*Mercy time (15%):* 13.2 hrs  

**Total Estimated Testing Effort: ~101 hrs**

---

== 3. Achievements

The following achievements must be achieved:

. Test Plan Approved  
. Test Cases Completed  
. Staging Environment Ready  
. Integration Testing Complete  
. System Testing Complete  
. Regression Cycle Complete  
. User Acceptance Testing Sign-off  
. Final Test Report Published  

---

== 4. Dependencies

The testing schedule depends on:

- Requirements and user stories availability  
- Working CI/CD pipeline  
- Staging environment readiness  
- Test accounts and credentials  
- Access to logs and monitoring  
- Feature freeze prior to regression/UAT  

---

== 5. Test Schedule

NOTE: Dates are placeholders and must align with the master project timeline.

[cols="1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Week | Focus | Deliverables | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria

| Week 1
| Planning and Test Case Design
| Test Plan and Test Cases v1
| Requirements available
| Plan approved and cases ready

| Week 2
| Integration and System Testing
| Defect log and status reports
| Staging build ready
| Critical defects resolved or mitigated

| Week 3
| Regression and UAT
| Regression report and UAT sign-off
| Fixes merged and stable build
| UAT passed and release candidate approved
|===

=== Recommended Cadence

- Daily QA sync during active testing  
- Defect triage three times per week  
- Stakeholder checkpoint before UAT  

---

== 6. Next Steps

- Insert actual calendar dates  
- Confirm resource availability  
- Review with stakeholders  
- Baseline the schedule
