*Final product:*
Page 1:  The “Unread” tab features orders received and unread by staff. Once these orders are viewed by staff and sent to the kitchen, they can be marked as “Opened”.  Each order can be tapped to open full order view, shown in page 4.

Page 2: The “Opened” tab shows orders sent to the kitchen but not yet ready for pickup. Each order can be tapped to open full order view, shown in page 5.

Page 3: The “Finished” tab shows orders that are ready and waiting for pick-up.

Page 4: The “Full order view” for unread orders shows an enlarged view of the customer order and features two buttons at the bottom to close order or send order to the opened tab.
