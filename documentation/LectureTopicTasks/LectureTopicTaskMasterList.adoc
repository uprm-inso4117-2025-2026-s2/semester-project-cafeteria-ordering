= Lecture Topic Task (LTT) Framework
:toc:
:sectnums:

== Purpose

This document defines eligible Lecture Topic Tasks (LTTs) for the Cafeteria Ordering System project.

Each student must complete four LTTs during the semester.  
LTTs replace individual homework assignments and must apply lecture concepts through structured, reviewable, and theory-driven work.

This document:

- Defines qualification criteria for LTT classification
- Provides representative lecture-aligned LTT options
- Distinguishes LTTs from routine development activities

== Scope

This framework does not attempt to enumerate every possible LTT.

Instead, it provides:

- Qualification criteria governing LTT eligibility
- Representative examples aligned with lecture topics
- A structural template for proposing additional LTTs

Team members may propose additional LTTs not listed here, provided they:

- Clearly align with a lecture topic
- Satisfy the defined qualification criteria
- Receive approval from the project lead

== LTT Qualification Criteria

A task qualifies as an LTT only if it:

1. Directly applies at least one lecture concept.
2. Extends beyond routine coding or documentation.
3. Produces a concrete, reviewable artifact.
4. Demonstrates theoretical understanding.
5. Can be completed individually.

Routine development activities — including standard feature implementation, basic unit testing, refactoring, configuration, or UI styling — do not qualify as LTTs.

Tasks that fail to satisfy these criteria may lose LTT classification.

Each LTT defined below specifies:

- Lecture alignment
- Deliverables
- Evidence of completion
- Justification
