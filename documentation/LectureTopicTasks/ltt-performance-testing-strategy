== Lecture Alignment

Lecture Topic: Performance Testing

In this LTT I applie lecture concepts on performance classification, load modeling, metric separation, and performance regression prevention.

== Purpose

The purpose of this LTT is to define a structured Performance Testing Strategy for the Cafeteria Ordering System that ensures scalability, responsiveness, and operational stability during peak usage periods.

This strategy defines high-level principles governing how performance testing will be approached, measured, and evaluated.

== Performance Testing Classification

The strategy distinguishes between the following testing types:

=== Performance Testing
Evaluation of individual system operations under normal load conditions.

=== Load Testing
Evaluation of system behavior under expected peak cafeteria demand.

=== Stress Testing
Evaluation of system behavior beyond expected load to identify failure thresholds.

=== Soak Testing
Long-duration testing to detect memory leaks, degradation, or resource exhaustion.

== Performance-Critical Components

The following components are considered performance-sensitive:

* Order placement and cart processing
* Payment processing service
* OTP locker validation service
* Notification dispatch mechanism
* Database transaction handling

== Performance Metrics Strategy

Performance metrics must be explicitly distinguished and not aggregated improperly.

The following metrics are prioritized:

* Response Time – time required to complete a user-visible action.
* Latency – time between request initiation and backend processing.
* Throughput – number of processed orders per unit time.
* Availability – percentage of uptime during operational hours.

Each metric will be measured independently to avoid masking degradation effects.

== Load Modeling Strategy

Peak usage modeling is based on realistic cafeteria demand scenarios:

* Concurrent users placing orders during lunch hours.
* Simultaneous payment confirmations.
* Parallel OTP validation requests.
* Sustained load over extended intervals.

Load modeling must reflect realistic concurrency patterns rather than artificial sequential execution.

== Environment Considerations

Performance testing must account for:

* Deployment environment differences (local vs production-like).
* Backend resource constraints.
* Network variability.
* Database contention.

Unrealistic testing environments may invalidate results.

== Benchmarking and Regression Prevention

Performance baselines will be recorded for core metrics.

Future releases will compare results against established benchmarks.

Significant regression in response time, throughput, or availability will block release approval.

== Deliverables

* Performance Testing Strategy document (this artifact).
* Defined performance metrics and thresholds.
* Defined peak-load modeling approach.
* Defined regression prevention strategy.

== Evidence of Completion

Committed AsciiDoc document demonstrating application of lecture concepts to system-specific context.

== Justification

This LTT applies theoretical performance testing principles discussed in lecture, including:

* Explicit classification of performance testing types.
* Separation of competing performance metrics.
* Realistic load modeling.
* Structured regression prevention.

The strategy extends beyond routine documentation and demonstrates conceptual application of performance engineering principles.
