=== 1.2 Current Situtation, needs, ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation
Eating at the university cafeteria is a necessity for many students, yet the current environment at the cafeteria is incapable of adequately meeting its high demand. The university cafeteria consistently experiences long lines and heavy traffic, particularly during peak hours. This inefficiency creates a recurring dilemma where students must choose between securing a meal or arriving on time for their next academic commitment. When students are forced to skip meals due to these waiting times, it can result in a substantial negative impact on their overall health, mental focus, and academic performance. The primary cause of this issue is an outdated manual, in-person ordering system that is simply not capable of handling a high volume of students in a short time frame. Currently in the cafeteria, every order and payment transaction is processed manually at the counter, as there is no existing infrastructure for pre-ordering or remote payment. Consequently, the absence of a streamlined, digital alternative to the manual counter process remains a major hurdle to both student well-being and cafeteria operational efficiency.

==== 1.2.2 Needs

The long wait times at the university cafeteria show unmet needs in food service and campus life, not in any specific system or technology. These needs come from how student schedules, cafeteria operations, and institutional restrictions interact, and as a consequence, they affect many stakeholders.

===== Students

* Be able to access meals within limited time windows between classes without risking tardiness or absence.
* Reduce uncertainty around how long it will take to obtain food, especially during peak cafeteria hours.
* Maintain consistent access to meals that supports health, focus, and academic performance.
* Avoid having to choose between basic needs and academic responsibilities.

===== Cafeteria Staff

* Handle high volumes of orders efficiently without excessive pressure during peak periods.
* Maintain a smooth operational flow that minimizes crowding and confusion at service points.
* Receive clearer signals about when demand will come and the volume of orders. This will help better manage preparation.

===== University Staff

* Ensure campus services support student retention, wellness, and academic success.
* Minimize crowds in shared spaces to improve safety and traffic flow.
* Balance service improvements with resource and staffing constraints.

===== System-Wide Needs

* Reduced trouble between ordering, preparation, payment, and pickup.
* Alignment between student schedules and cafeteria service capacity.
* A food-service process that adapts to peak demand patterns.
* Meals can be obtained reliably and on time, even during busy periods.

===== Project Level Needs

* A clear statement of requirements based on stakeholder needs, without reference to any system. 
* A common language used in analysis, design, implementation, and testing to avoid confusion. 
* Planning documents (requirements, architecture, design, and test strategy) to support the solution selected later.
* A general description of cafeteria operations and how stakeholders interact. 

==== 1.2.3 Ideas

* Welcome to the Cafeteria ordering application, a platform where students and staff from the university community can easily order food from the university cafeteria, drastically reducing the waiting time and facilitating staff work.

* Ordering: Now, it’s easier than ever to order from the cafeteria! When a user wants to order an item, the available menu will be displayed with different sections depending on the type of food, sides, snacks and beverages. If an item from the menu is not available, it will not be able to be selected to order. After the user picks out what they want to order, they can choose whether to pay at the register or pay on the app, then, simply click order and done!

* Pick up times: The user can choose whether to schedule to pick up an order, or also, order instantly to be pick up as soon as possible.

*Notification system: The project will include notifications for both the user and the cafeteria staff to keep them informed about the status of an order, to improve communication and help coordinate order preparation and pickup.

* Order security: when the user wants to pick up an order in the designated pick-up station, the user will be given a code that they have to confirm with the staff to then be able to pick up their order, vastly reducing the possibility of having a customer’s order stolen.

*Cafeteria mode: For the staff to monitor the orders, an “admin mode” will be integrated so that all the orders along with their pickup time will be displayed for the cafeteria staff, as well as notify them for order cancellations, any notes from the orders, etc. The staff will be able to input when an order is being processed, and when the order has been completed.

*Feedback: The app will ask the users for any feedback after an order has been processed and confirmed, this way, the team can make improvements and tweaks to the application and make the service better.

=== 1.5 Derived Goals

In addition to the primary goal of reducing wait times and improving access to meals in the university cafeteria, the project also pursues several secondary but meaningful outcomes.

One derived goal is to contribute to improve student well-being beyond the immediate act of ordering food. By supporting more predictable access to meals, the project may contribute to promoting healthier daily routines, better time management, and reduced stress during peak academic hours. While the primary objective focuses on operational efficiency, this broader impact on student life represents an important secondary benefit.

Another goal is to support data-informed decision making within cafeteria operations. Even if not fully implemented in early stages, the structured collection of order and demand information creates the possibility for future analysis of peak times, popular menu items, and service bottlenecks. This can help cafeteria management optimize staffing, preparation strategies, and inventory planning over time.

The project also aims to encourage digital transformation within campus services. By introducing a structured, mobile-based ordering approach, the system may serve as a model for how other campus services might modernize their processes. This broader institutional impact extends beyond the cafeteria itself and contributes to a more technology-integrated campus environment.

A further derived goal is to strengthen collaboration and coordination among stakeholders. The structured interaction between students, cafeteria staff, and university administration fosters clearer communication channels and more transparent service processes. Even outside the application’s technical implementation, this improved alignment between stakeholders is a valuable outcome.

At the project level, another secondary goal is to develop strong engineering practices within the team. Through domain analysis, requirements engineering, architectural planning, testing strategies, and documentation, the team builds experience in systematic software development. The artifacts produced during this process—such as requirement specifications, design descriptions, and test plans—form a reusable knowledge base for future academic or professional projects.

Finally, the project seeks to raise awareness about the importance of aligning campus services with student needs. By formally analyzing the current situation and articulating stakeholder needs, the project highlights the connection between operational systems and academic success. This reflective understanding of service design within the university context represents a broader outcome beyond the immediate functionality of the Cafeteria Ordering System.

== Descriptive Part

=== 2.1 Domain Description

==== 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch

The following snippets are raw records of observations and stakeholder experiences within the university cafeteria.

* The 10-Minute Dash: A student walks from the Engineering building toward the cafeteria at 12:05 PM. A small group arrives at the cafeteria at the same time to find a line that extends about 15 people toward the hallway. Some people looks at their watch and decide to walk to their next classroom. They are heard muttering that they'll just have to wait until 4:00 PM to eat.

* The Kitchen's Blind Spot: The kitchen staff members create multiple big trays which contain the "El colegial special" in the back of the kitchen. The team operates at high speed but maintains uncertainty about whether 10 or 100 students will enter the building within the next ten minutes will order. The staff members display visible pressure when 20 students enter the service area which becomes overlwhelming.

* The Post-Lunch Fatigue: Multiple students show signs of falling asleep during the 2:00 PM Biology lecture while they try to maintain their attention on the lesson. A student, when exiting the class, states that he skipped the meal because of the long line which may have caused him to miss his class. The student explained that his lack of food would affect his mental focus and academic performance throughout the day.

* The Payment Bottleneck: A student reaches the front of the line and is told that the payment system is down. The student waits for 3 minutes while the staff tries to fix the issue. Then, the student and every person behind him/her becomes visibly frustrated and expresses concern about being late for their next class.

* The uncertainty of the menu: A student stands at the back of the line, which has spilled out into the hallway near the exit of the cafeteria. From this distance, he cannot see the daily whiteboard or the steam table. He spends 5 minutes moving forward to only discover what the sides or prices are once they are two people away from the counter.

==== 2.1.2 Terminology

==== 2.1.3 Domain Terminology in Relation to Domain Rough Sketch

This section relates the defined domain terminology (Section 2.1.2) to specific observations documented in the domain rough sketch (Section 2.1.1). The terminology presented here represents processed and abstracted concepts derived from real-world domain phenomena observed in stakeholder experiences and operational conditions.

The rough sketch provides raw observations of behaviors, constraints, and interactions within the cafeteria environment. Through analysis, these observations were abstracted into formal domain concepts, entities, actions, events, attributes, and behaviors.

The following relationships illustrate how domain terminology originates from observed domain phenomena:

* Queue, Waiting Time, and Student Has Just Joined the Queue  
- Derived from *The 10-Minute Dash*, where students encounter a line extending approximately 15 people into the hallway. This observation demonstrates the existence of an ordered sequence of students waiting for service (Queue), measurable delays between joining and receiving service (Waiting Time), and the identifiable moment when a student enters the queue (Student Has Just Joined the Queue).

* Student Has Just Left the Queue Without Ordering and Time-Constrained Decision Making  
- Derived from *The 10-Minute Dash* and *The Post-Lunch Fatigue*, where students decide to leave the line due to insufficient available time before their next academic commitment. These observations reveal that students evaluate waiting time against external time constraints, resulting in the observable event of abandoning the queue.

* Meal, Meal Preparation, and Batch Preparation Under Unpredictable Circumstances  
- Derived from *The Kitchen's Blind Spot*, where cafeteria staff prepare multiple trays of meals without precise knowledge of how many students will arrive. This demonstrates the existence of prepared food units (Meal), the act of producing those meals (Meal Preparation), and the behavior of preparing food under demand uncertainty (Batch Preparation Under Unpredictable Circumstances).

* Crowd Surge and Service Bottleneck  
- Derived from *The Kitchen's Blind Spot* and *The Payment Bottleneck*, where sudden increases in arriving students create operational pressure and service delays. These observations establish the behavior of rapid increases in student arrival (Crowd Surge) and the resulting slowdown in service processes (Service Bottleneck).

* Order, Order Placement, and Order Has Just Been Placed  
- Derived implicitly from all rough sketch scenarios involving students progressing through the cafeteria service process. These observations demonstrate that students communicate requests for meals, resulting in identifiable moments when requests are formally made.

* Payment and Payment Has Just Failed  
- Derived from *The Payment Bottleneck*, where the payment system becomes unavailable, preventing students from completing transactions. This observation demonstrates the existence of a monetary exchange process (Payment) and identifiable failure events within that process (Payment Has Just Failed).

* Menu and Menu Visibility Constraints  
- Derived from *The Uncertainty of the Menu*, where students are unable to see available meal options or prices until reaching the front of the queue. This establishes the existence of a defined set of available meal options (Menu) and the dependency of student decision-making on access to this information.

* Meal Pickup and Meal Has Just Been Prepared  
- Derived from the implicit service flow observed across all rough sketch scenarios, where meals are prepared and subsequently transferred to students. This establishes the existence of a distinct moment when a meal becomes available (Meal Has Just Been Prepared) and the act of receiving that meal (Meal Pickup).

* Cafeteria Staff and Operational Pressure Under Demand Variability  
- Derived from *The Kitchen's Blind Spot* and *The Payment Bottleneck*, where staff members prepare meals and respond to sudden increases in student arrivals and operational disruptions. These observations establish cafeteria staff as active domain entities responsible for food preparation and service execution.

These relationships demonstrate that the terminology defined in Section 2.1.2 is not arbitrary, but rather the result of systematic abstraction and formalization of domain phenomena observed in the rough sketch. This ensures that the terminology accurately reflects the domain environment and provides a reliable conceptual foundation for subsequent domain modeling and requirements analysis.
