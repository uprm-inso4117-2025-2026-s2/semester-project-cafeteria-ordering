=== 1.1 Team

==== Team Structure
The project team is organized into four functional divisions: Documentation, Test Planning, Research and Set Up, and UI. Each division has a designated Team Lead responsible for coordinating tasks, tracking progress, and ensuring alignment with project requirements. All team members contribute collaboratively while focusing on their division’s primary objectives.

==== Managers
The overall coordination of the project is led by:

* Alma D. Piñero-Calero
* Taimara P. Colon-Lopez

The managers oversee progress across all divisions, facilitate communication between teams, and ensure that project milestones and academic requirements are met.

===== Partners

At this stage of the project, no external partners have been formally integrated. All current partners are internal team members and project managers who have direct responsibility in development and coordination. End users of the application are considered customers rather than partners.

If external partners become involved in later phases, their roles and responsibilities will be formally documented here.

=== 1.2 Current Situtation, needs, ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation
Eating at the university cafeteria is a necessity for many students, yet the current environment at the cafeteria is incapable of adequately meeting its high demand. The university cafeteria consistently experiences long lines and heavy traffic, particularly during peak hours. This inefficiency creates a recurring dilemma where students must choose between securing a meal or arriving on time for their next academic commitment. When students are forced to skip meals due to these waiting times, it can result in a substantial negative impact on their overall health, mental focus, and academic performance. The primary cause of this issue is an outdated manual, in-person ordering system that is simply not capable of handling a high volume of students in a short time frame. Currently in the cafeteria, every order and payment transaction is processed manually at the counter, as there is no existing infrastructure for pre-ordering or remote payment. Consequently, the absence of a streamlined, digital alternative to the manual counter process remains a major hurdle to both student well-being and cafeteria operational efficiency.

==== 1.2.2 Needs

The long wait times at the university cafeteria show unmet needs in food service and campus life, not in any specific system or technology. These needs come from how student schedules, cafeteria operations, and institutional restrictions interact, and as a consequence, they affect many stakeholders.

===== Students

* Be able to access meals within limited time windows between classes without risking tardiness or absence.
* Reduce uncertainty around how long it will take to obtain food, especially during peak cafeteria hours.
* Maintain consistent access to meals that supports health, focus, and academic performance.
* Avoid having to choose between basic needs and academic responsibilities.

===== Cafeteria Staff

* Handle high volumes of orders efficiently without excessive pressure during peak periods.
* Maintain a smooth operational flow that minimizes crowding and confusion at service points.
* Receive clearer signals about when demand will come and the volume of orders. This will help better manage preparation.

===== University Staff

* Ensure campus services support student retention, wellness, and academic success.
* Minimize crowds in shared spaces to improve safety and traffic flow.
* Balance service improvements with resource and staffing constraints.

===== System-Wide Needs

* Reduced trouble between ordering, preparation, payment, and pickup.
* Alignment between student schedules and cafeteria service capacity.
* A food-service process that adapts to peak demand patterns.
* Meals can be obtained reliably and on time, even during busy periods.

===== Project Level Needs

* A clear statement of requirements based on stakeholder needs, without reference to any system. 
* A common language used in analysis, design, implementation, and testing to avoid confusion. 
* Planning documents (requirements, architecture, design, and test strategy) to support the solution selected later.
* A general description of cafeteria operations and how stakeholders interact.
