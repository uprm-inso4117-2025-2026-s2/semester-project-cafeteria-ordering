=== 1.1 Team

==== Team Structure
The project team is organized into four functional divisions: Documentation, Test Planning, Research and Set Up, and UI. Each division has a designated Team Lead responsible for coordinating tasks, tracking progress, and ensuring alignment with project requirements. All team members contribute collaboratively while focusing on their division’s primary objectives.

==== Managers
The overall coordination of the project is led by:

* Alma D. Piñero-Calero
* Taimara P. Colon-Lopez

The managers oversee progress across all divisions, facilitate communication between teams, and ensure that project milestones and academic requirements are met.

===== Partners

At this stage of the project, no external partners have been formally integrated. All current partners are internal team members and project managers who have direct responsibility in development and coordination. End users of the application are considered customers rather than partners.

If external partners become involved in later phases, their roles and responsibilities will be formally documented here.

=== 1.2 Current Situtation, needs, ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation
Eating at the university cafeteria is a necessity for many students, yet the current environment at the cafeteria is incapable of adequately meeting its high demand. The university cafeteria consistently experiences long lines and heavy traffic, particularly during peak hours. This inefficiency creates a recurring dilemma where students must choose between securing a meal or arriving on time for their next academic commitment. When students are forced to skip meals due to these waiting times, it can result in a substantial negative impact on their overall health, mental focus, and academic performance. The primary cause of this issue is an outdated manual, in-person ordering system that is simply not capable of handling a high volume of students in a short time frame. Currently in the cafeteria, every order and payment transaction is processed manually at the counter, as there is no existing infrastructure for pre-ordering or remote payment. Consequently, the absence of a streamlined, digital alternative to the manual counter process remains a major hurdle to both student well-being and cafeteria operational efficiency.
