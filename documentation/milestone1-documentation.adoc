=== 1.2 Current Situtation, needs, ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation
Eating at the university cafeteria is a necessity for many students, yet the current environment at the cafeteria is incapable of adequately meeting its high demand. The university cafeteria consistently experiences long lines and heavy traffic, particularly during peak hours. This inefficiency creates a recurring dilemma where students must choose between securing a meal or arriving on time for their next academic commitment. When students are forced to skip meals due to these waiting times, it can result in a substantial negative impact on their overall health, mental focus, and academic performance. The primary cause of this issue is an outdated manual, in-person ordering system that is simply not capable of handling a high volume of students in a short time frame. Currently in the cafeteria, every order and payment transaction is processed manually at the counter, as there is no existing infrastructure for pre-ordering or remote payment. Consequently, the absence of a streamlined, digital alternative to the manual counter process remains a major hurdle to both student well-being and cafeteria operational efficiency.

==== 1.2.2 Needs

The long wait times at the university cafeteria show unmet needs in food service and campus life, not in any specific system or technology. These needs come from how student schedules, cafeteria operations, and institutional restrictions interact, and as a consequence, they affect many stakeholders.

===== Students

* Be able to access meals within limited time windows between classes without risking tardiness or absence.
* Reduce uncertainty around how long it will take to obtain food, especially during peak cafeteria hours.
* Maintain consistent access to meals that supports health, focus, and academic performance.
* Avoid having to choose between basic needs and academic responsibilities.

===== Cafeteria Staff

* Handle high volumes of orders efficiently without excessive pressure during peak periods.
* Maintain a smooth operational flow that minimizes crowding and confusion at service points.
* Receive clearer signals about when demand will come and the volume of orders. This will help better manage preparation.

===== University Staff

* Ensure campus services support student retention, wellness, and academic success.
* Minimize crowds in shared spaces to improve safety and traffic flow.
* Balance service improvements with resource and staffing constraints.

===== System-Wide Needs

* Reduced trouble between ordering, preparation, payment, and pickup.
* Alignment between student schedules and cafeteria service capacity.
* A food-service process that adapts to peak demand patterns.
* Meals can be obtained reliably and on time, even during busy periods.

===== Project Level Needs

* A clear statement of requirements based on stakeholder needs, without reference to any system. 
* A common language used in analysis, design, implementation, and testing to avoid confusion. 
* Planning documents (requirements, architecture, design, and test strategy) to support the solution selected later.
* A general description of cafeteria operations and how stakeholders interact. 

==== 1.2.3 Ideas

* Welcome to the Cafeteria ordering application, a platform where students and staff from the university community can easily order food from the university cafeteria, drastically reducing the waiting time and facilitating staff work.

* Ordering: Now, it’s easier than ever to order from the cafeteria! When a user wants to order an item, the available menu will be displayed with different sections depending on the type of food, sides, snacks and beverages. If an item from the menu is not available, it will not be able to be selected to order. After the user picks out what they want to order, they can choose whether to pay at the register or pay on the app, then, simply click order and done!

* Pick up times: The user can choose whether to schedule to pick up an order, or also, order instantly to be pick up as soon as possible.

*Notification system: The project will include notifications for both the user and the cafeteria staff to keep them informed about the status of an order, to improve communication and help coordinate order preparation and pickup.

* Order security: when the user wants to pick up an order in the designated pick-up station, the user will be given a code that they have to confirm with the staff to then be able to pick up their order, vastly reducing the possibility of having a customer’s order stolen.

*Cafeteria mode: For the staff to monitor the orders, an “admin mode” will be integrated so that all the orders along with their pickup time will be displayed for the cafeteria staff, as well as notify them for order cancellations, any notes from the orders, etc. The staff will be able to input when an order is being processed, and when the order has been completed.

*Feedback: The app will ask the users for any feedback after an order has been processed and confirmed, this way, the team can make improvements and tweaks to the application and make the service better.

=== 1.3 Scope, Span and Synopsis

==== 1.3.1 Scope and Span

==== 1.3.2 Synopsis

=== 1.4 Other Activities than just developing source code

Developing a software solution is only one part of this project. Thought it may seem that way, the issues in the university cafeteria are not purely technical. They come from operational complexity, limited time between classes, and the interactions of stakeholders. Because of this, the project requires several supporting activities other than implementation to ensure that any future solution is effective and sustainable.

==== A key activity for this project is understanding and structuring the domain.

* Cafeteria operations during peak hours rely heavily on manual and informal processes, which makes it difficult to clearly understand how ordering, payment, preparation, and pickup relate to one another.
* Creating a domain description would help the team form a shared understanding of these workflows and constraints before moving toward any specific solution.

==== Another important activity is requirements engineering. Although the current situation reveals clear inefficiencies and frustration, there is no formal description of what an improved cafeteria experience should provide for its users.

* Defining requirements helps clarify expectations around functionality, performance, and usage from the perspective of students, staff, and administrators.
* Having explicit requirements ensures that later design and implementation decisions are guided by stakeholder needs rather than assumptions.

==== Early design and architectural reasoning are also necessary before any code is written.

* Because there is no existing digital infrastructure supporting peak-hour cafeteria operations, system structure and responsibilities cannot be taken from prior solutions. 
* Planning the system architecture and components early helps manage complexity and reduces the risk of poorly structured designs.

==== Planning for testing and evaluation is another essential activity.

* The cafeteria environment is highly time-sensitive, which makes reliability and usability especially important.
* Thinking ahead about how the system will be evaluated allows the team to measure improvements such as reduced waiting times and smoother order pickup once a solution is in place.

==== Finally, coordination and project organization tie all project activities together.

* Establishing milestones, documenting decisions, and assigning responsibilities helps keep the team aligned throughout the project.
* Maintaining communication with stakeholders supports scope management, progress tracking, and preparation for future iterations or expansion.

By combining domain understanding, requirements definition, design planning, testing preparation, and strong coordination with implementation, the project addresses both the technical and operational factors contributing to the current cafeteria situation.

=== 1.5 Derived Goals

In addition to the primary goal of reducing wait times and improving access to meals in the university cafeteria, the project also pursues several secondary but meaningful outcomes.

One derived goal is to contribute to improve student well-being beyond the immediate act of ordering food. By supporting more predictable access to meals, the project may contribute to promoting healthier daily routines, better time management, and reduced stress during peak academic hours. While the primary objective focuses on operational efficiency, this broader impact on student life represents an important secondary benefit.

Another goal is to support data-informed decision making within cafeteria operations. Even if not fully implemented in early stages, the structured collection of order and demand information creates the possibility for future analysis of peak times, popular menu items, and service bottlenecks. This can help cafeteria management optimize staffing, preparation strategies, and inventory planning over time.

The project also aims to encourage digital transformation within campus services. By introducing a structured, mobile-based ordering approach, the system may serve as a model for how other campus services might modernize their processes. This broader institutional impact extends beyond the cafeteria itself and contributes to a more technology-integrated campus environment.

A further derived goal is to strengthen collaboration and coordination among stakeholders. The structured interaction between students, cafeteria staff, and university administration fosters clearer communication channels and more transparent service processes. Even outside the application’s technical implementation, this improved alignment between stakeholders is a valuable outcome.

At the project level, another secondary goal is to develop strong engineering practices within the team. Through domain analysis, requirements engineering, architectural planning, testing strategies, and documentation, the team builds experience in systematic software development. The artifacts produced during this process—such as requirement specifications, design descriptions, and test plans—form a reusable knowledge base for future academic or professional projects.

Finally, the project seeks to raise awareness about the importance of aligning campus services with student needs. By formally analyzing the current situation and articulating stakeholder needs, the project highlights the connection between operational systems and academic success. This reflective understanding of service design within the university context represents a broader outcome beyond the immediate functionality of the Cafeteria Ordering System.
