= Identify Risks to be Addressed (Risk-Based Test Planning)

== Purpose  
Apply risk-based testing to the Cafeteria Ordering System.  Focus on risks that could undermine the project goal (reducing cafeteria wait times).  For each risk we record Likelihood and Impact (1-5), calculate a Risk Score (LxI), and define mitigation/contingency actions that direct test focus.

== Scoring Rubric  
*Likelihood (L) 1-5:* Probability of risk occurrence (1=Rare … 5=Almost Certain).  
*Impact (I) 1-5:* Effect on the project if the risk occurs (1=Negligible … 5=Critical).  
*Risk Score:* LxI (1-25); higher = more severe.

|ID|Risk Statement|Category|L|I|Score|Mitigation|Contingency|Test Planning Consequence

|R-01 
|Incorrect order totals or item selection (e.g. wrong price or qty) resulting in wrong orders. 
|Technical 
|4|5|20 
|Enforce input validation; unit-test pricing logic; code review on cart modules. 
|Quick rollback of pricing logic; offer manual correction option. 
|Add extensive functional tests for cart/checkout (normal & boundary cases); focus on negative/edge tests first.

|R-02 
|Order state management bugs (e.g. placed→ready→picked up) causing lost, duplicate, or stuck orders. 
|Technical 
|4|4|16 
|Use single source of truth for order state; integration tests for state transitions. 
|Activate manual reconciliation (staff fix); clear stuck orders periodically. 
|Prioritize integration tests for order workflow; test idempotency, retry logic, and state edge cases.

|R-03 
|High concurrency/peak load (rainy days/meal rush) causing timeouts or data conflicts. 
|Technical 
|3|5|15 
|Implement server-side rate-limiting or queuing; load-test early with peak scenarios. 
|Throttle requests; temporarily disable non-critical features under stress. 
|Perform load/performance tests simulating peak usage; include duplicate-click and retry scenarios.

|R-04 
|Inadequate or unstable test environment/data (e.g. missing menu items, poor test data) leads to false confidence. 
|Resource 
|4|4|16 
|Create stable seed dataset and restore process; document environment setup. 
|Use last-known-good data snapshot; limit new test cases until fixed. 
|Enforce “test data readiness” as entry criterion; allocate time to set up and maintain realistic test data early.

|R-05 
|Requirements changes or scope creep (mid-sprint) cause test plan churn and coverage gaps. 
|Schedule 
|4|4|16 
|Baseline requirements each sprint; require documented change requests. 
|Defer or reduce lower-risk tests; concentrate on core features. 
|Use risk scores to defend scope; treat changed features as regression candidates for retesting.

|R-06 
|Usability/UX issues (complex UI, unclear workflow) leading to order abandonment or misuse. 
|Technical 
|3|4|12 
|Apply simple UI design principles; conduct quick heuristic review or mini-usability testing. 
|Provide additional guidance/tooltips; simplify flow (reduce clicks). 
|Include usability scenarios (e.g. place-order time) in tests; monitor task completion and error rates.

|R-07 
|Resource constraints (limited test time/people) reducing test coverage and leading to defects in release. 
|Resource 
|4|4|16 
|Use risk-based prioritization; automate core smoke tests; define clear entry/exit criteria. 
|Cut low-value tests; extend schedule if possible; communicate reduced scope. 
|Build a minimal regression suite first; focus human testing on top-risk areas; gate merges on smoke tests.

|R-08 
|Integration mismatches (UI ↔ API ↔ DB) causing hidden defects not caught by unit tests. 
|Technical 
|3|4|12 
|Define API contracts; add end-to-end integration tests. 
|Roll back faulty API changes; add data validation layers. 
|Write integration/contract tests early; include them in nightly/regression builds.

|R-09 
|Performance targets missed (slow page loads or submit times) hurting the “quick” ordering goal. 
|Technical 
|3|4|12 
|Set performance budgets (e.g. checkout <2s); run basic perf tests after each build. 
|Optimize code paths; cache static content; scale resources. 
|Add performance checks (page load times, throughput) aligned with expected peak; treat violations as defects.

|R-10 
|Security/auth issues (if applicable, e.g. data leaks or unauthorized access) causing downtime or trust loss. 
|Technical 
|2|5|10 
|Enforce authentication and input sanitization; code scan for vulnerabilities. 
|Isolate system; deploy fixes/patches. 
|Include security test cases; prioritize testing any login, personal data, or admin features.

== Top 5 Risks (Summary)  
[cols="1,3,4", options="header"]
|===
| ID | Risk (short) | Test-Planning Consequence
| R-01 | Wrong order totals or items | Expand functional tests for cart/checkout (add negative and edge cases, verify pricing logic).
| R-02 | Order state workflow errors | Prioritize end-to-end tests for the order lifecycle (state transitions, retries, idempotency).
| R-04 | Unstable test data/environment | Allocate effort to prepare reliable test data/environment before other tests; add data validation.
| R-05 | Requirements/scope changes | Use risk scores to trim low-risk tests; require additional regression tests for changed features.
| R-07 | Insufficient test resources | Build a core smoke/regression suite first; focus human testers on top-risk areas.
