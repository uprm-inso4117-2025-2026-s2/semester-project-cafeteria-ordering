= Entry, Exit, and Stop Testing Criteria In All Testing Phases
:author: Devlin Hahn

== Executive Summary

This document defines clear, measurable entry, exit, and stop criteria for all testing phases of the University Cafeteria Ordering System. These criteria establish objective quality gates that ensure testing activities are consistent, prevent premature testing or release decisions, and provide transparent benchmarks for stakeholders. The criteria cover four testing levels: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing.

== 1. Testing Levels Overview

The project follows a sequential testing approach with four distinct phases:

[options="header"]
|===
| Testing Level | Focus | Responsible Party
| Unit Testing | Individual components/functions in isolation | Developers
| Integration Testing | Interactions between integrated components/modules | Developers + QA
| System Testing | End-to-end functionality of complete system | QA Team
| Acceptance Testing | Validation against business requirements and user needs | QA + Product Owners + Stakeholders
|===

Each phase has specific entry criteria (what must be true before starting), exit criteria (what must be true to consider the phase complete), and stop criteria (conditions that justify halting testing).
