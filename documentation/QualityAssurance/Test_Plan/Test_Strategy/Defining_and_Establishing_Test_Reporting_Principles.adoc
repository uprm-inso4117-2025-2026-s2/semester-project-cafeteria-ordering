= Test Reporting Principles


== Introduction
In any structured software development project, testing alone is not sufficient to guarantee product quality. The true effectiveness of testing depends on how results are communicated, interpreted, and acted upon. Without clearly defined test reporting principles, test outcomes can become inconsistent, misunderstood, or overlooked, increasing project risk.

Establishing Test Reporting Principles ensures that all testing results are documented in a consistent and traceable manner. A structured reporting framework promotes transparency, accountability, and informed decision‑making by defining how results are recorded, who reviews them, and how failures are resolved.

== Level Definitions

=== Developer Level
The developer is responsible for reporting on unit tests related to the code they implemented. They ensure their code functions correctly before integration.

=== Team Level
This level covers testing activities that affect shared modules, integrations, or system behavior. Results must be reviewed collectively by the team.

=== Stakeholder Level
This level includes high‑level test results intended for managers and project stakeholders. Reports summarize system stability, release readiness, critical defects, and overall quality.

== Types of Tests Requiring Reporting

=== Unit Testing
Validates individual components in isolation before integration. Reporting ensures early defect detection and prevents unstable code from entering the project.

*Covered by:* Developers and Teams.

=== Integration Testing
Ensures combined components work as intended. Reporting identifies interface defects, data inconsistencies, and communication failures.

*Covered by:* Team.

=== Acceptance Testing
Ensures delivered code satisfies project requirements. Reporting highlights failed acceptance criteria and supports release decisions.

*Covered by:* Stakeholders and Developers.

=== Non‑Functional Testing
Evaluates reliability, scalability, maintainability, and security. Reporting identifies risks affecting release readiness.

*Covered by:* Team and Stakeholders.

=== Performance Testing
Measures responsiveness, stability, and scalability under load. Reporting tracks performance against thresholds.

*Covered by:* Team and Stakeholders.

=== Usability Testing
Assesses user‑friendliness and intuitiveness. Reporting documents design or interaction flaws.

*Covered by:* Stakeholders.

=== A/B Testing
Compares two feature versions to determine which performs better. Reporting supports evidence‑based decisions.

*Covered by:* Stakeholders.

=== Documentation Testing
Verifies documentation completeness, accuracy, and clarity. Reporting prevents misinformation.

*Covered by:* Developers, Teams, and Stakeholders.

== Desired Reporting Format
All test reports must be documented to track progress and ensure no unresolved issues affect the project long‑term.

Each test report must include:

* Issue or code reference
* Date of test execution
* Tester name
* Pass/Fail status
* Detailed description of what was tested and what passed/failed

== Pass/Fail Criteria

=== Pass Criteria
A test passes when:

* All requirements are fulfilled
* No errors are present
* Code is clean and understandable
* A report is completed using the correct format

=== Fail Criteria
A test fails when:

* Requirements are unfulfilled
* Code contains errors
* Issues could negatively impact the project

The responsible developer must be notified to fix the issue. A test report must be completed, and additional developers may be assigned if needed.

== Responsibility & Governance

=== Responsibilities

* *Developers:* Ensure all code passes unit tests and fix defects before submission.
* *Team:* Execute integration and non‑functional tests, prepare reports, and verify defect resolution.
* *Stakeholders:* Review milestone test reports and approve or reject milestone completion.

=== Governance Principles

* Every test executed within a milestone must be documented and stored.
* Failed tests must be resolved before milestone approval.
* Traceability between requirements, test cases, defects, and reports must be verified.
* Each milestone must meet project quality standards before progressing.

== Metrics & Traceability
Metrics and traceability are essential for monitoring project quality and ensuring requirement compliance.

Recorded metrics include:

* Test execution status
* Defect severity
* System performance

Traceability links:

* Requirements → Test cases → Test results → Defects

This enables informed decisions, requirement verification, and an auditable quality assurance record.

== Conclusion
Clear Test Reporting Principles are essential for project success. Structured reporting ensures that all tests are documented, reviewed, and communicated across Developer, Team, and Stakeholder levels. Defined responsibilities and governance ensure quality and defect resolution. Metrics and traceability provide transparency and alignment with requirements. Together, these principles create a controlled and reliable testing environment that supports long‑term project stability.
