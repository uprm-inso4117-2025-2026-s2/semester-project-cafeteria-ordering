= Base Auto Test Suite

== Scope:

The following files define the baseline automated test suite:

- .github/workflows/auto_test_suite.yml

- package.json

== Purpose:
The purpose of this configuration is to establish a minimal baseline automated test suite that validates the project builds successfully before code is merged into the main branch.

== Code and Justification

This section reivews the code in segments, explaining the reasoning behind each choice

== Trigger Configuration
.Job Triggers:

[source, yml]
----
on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        types: [opened, edited]
        branches: [main]
----

The workflow defines two trigger events:

- Push events: executes when commits are pushed directly

- Pull request events: executes when pull requests targeting main are opened or edited

This configuration ensures build validation occurs automatically whenever changes are proposed for or introduced to the main branch.

== Job Specifications

.Job tasks:
[source,yml]
----
jobs:

    build-and-lint:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Check-out repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: install dependencies
          run: npm install
        - name: lint and build
          run: npm run ci-check
----

== Job Execution Details:
.Process name
[source,yml]
----
build-and-lint:
----

The job is named `build-and-lint` to clearly indicate its dual purpose: validating the build process while also running linting checks. 

.Build Environment
[source,yml]
----
runs on: ubuntu-latest
----
The workflow executes on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu virtual machines. Using `ubuntu-latest` provides several benefits:

- Ensures consistent build environments across runs

- Receives automatic security patches and OS-level updates

- Leverages GitHub's optimized infrastructure for fast execution

.Execution Steps:

.Machine set-up
[source,yml]
----
- name: Check-out repo
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
----
This step clones the repository into the virtual machine environment, making the codebase available for subsequent build operations.

.Build commands
[source,yml]
----
- name: install dependencies
  run: npm install
- name: lint and build
  run: npm run ci-check
----

The project utilizes Node.js, enabling straightforward build instructions:

`npm install` retrieves and installs all project dependencies as defined in `package.json`

`npm run ci-check` executes a custom script that combines linting and build verification

The ci-check script, defined in `package.json`, sequentially runs:

`npm run lint` - Performs code linting to enforce style and quality standards

`npx expo export` - Validates the build process by generating a production export`
